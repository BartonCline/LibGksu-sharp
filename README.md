LibGksu-sharp
=============

This is a C# wrapper around libgksu2 (gtk2) using monodevelop 5.
If you are a C# developer on linux and have found yourself in need of elevated permissions, this may just be what you have been looking for. It was a real stroke of luck that libgksu has not been dragged through the mire that is gtk3. I've wrapped library calls in sensible constructors and properties. Please let me know if I've missed anything.
